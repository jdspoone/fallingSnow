Based on what we planned to have done by the end of the weekend, we still need to do the following:
    -Implement a perspective camera and actually render the points weâ€™re passing to OpenGl
    -Implement a geometry shader which turns a single point into 2 triangles composing a square
    -Implement basic particle emission, probably just returning a particle to the top of the domain when it hits the bottom
