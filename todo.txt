The Particle Model:
   1. Render a scene of stationary 'snowflakes' (probably just triangles), and sort them on the GPU by distance from the camera (perhaps making a triangle's colour a function of it's distance from the camera)
   2. Extend to allow downward motion of particles, as well as the continual creation of new particles from the top of the particle domain
   3. Extend with primitive wind model

The Individual Snowflakes:
   1. Render a simple, fractal based snowflake with gaussian translucency
   2. Render this snowflakes in place of every particle in the particle model

The Aggregate Snow:
   1. Modify fragment shader to apply 'fog' based on the distance of the point from the camera.
